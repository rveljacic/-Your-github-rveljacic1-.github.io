# Understanding the Repo for development

### Setup
We will be using node v8 or node v10
- `cd smart-contracts`
- `yarn install` or ` npm install`
- `cd ../frontend`
- `yarn install` or `npm install`
- `yarn start` or `npm run start`

### Smart Contracts

This project uses [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com) to handle all of the smart contract related work.

In the `/smart-contracts/contracts` folder, you will find `DoubleOrNothing.sol` which contains the game logic.
 
After you make any updates to it, you will have to redeploy the contract.

`yarn migrate --network development/thunder --reset` or `npm run migrate -- --network development/thunder --reset`

** Development points to localhost:8545 [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
 
** To deploy on thunder, you must add a mnemonic to `/smart-contracts/truffle-config.js`

### Frontend
The frontend is built using the [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
To interact with the chain, we use [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/).
